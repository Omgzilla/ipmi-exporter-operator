description: >
  This is an IPMI exporter for Prometheus.

  It supports both the regular /metrics endpoint, exposing metrics from the host that the exporter is running on, as well as an /ipmi endpoint that supports IPMI over RMCP - one exporter running on one host can be used to monitor a large number of IPMI interfaces by passing the target parameter to a scrape.

  The exporter relies on tools from the FreeIPMI suite for the actual IPMI implementation.
